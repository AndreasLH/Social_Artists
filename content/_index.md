# Hip Hop

We have chosen to analyse the network of hip-hoppers since it is an interesting segment of musicians. Our hypothesis is that they tend to work and collaborate together a lot

## Libraries

Many of the plots on this website are created using the plotly library and are interactive

Most of the network analysis is conducted in ```networkx```. Visualization in ```netwulf```. Community detection with the python [louvain packackage](https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain)


## [Explainer Notebook](explainer-notebook.html)

The linked jupyter notebook contains all the relevant analysis, which has been made in python. In there you can find all the technical details of how everything has been implemented and calculated.
